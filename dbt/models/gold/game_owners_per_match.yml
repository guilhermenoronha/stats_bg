          The Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for 'Sommelier of the Year' is designed to reward game variety. 
          It is calculated as: KPI = Σ (1 / n) where *n* is the total number of times a specific game has been played.
          This formula applies a decreasing marginal weight to each repeated play of the same game, 
          thereby favoring a diverse portfolio of games played over a high volume of plays for a single game.
